# Sometimes you have to write to figure it out

>Your real problem is that you don’t know what you think   
Sometimes you have to write to figure it out

>Sometimes you have to live to figure out   
Meticolous plans often don’t hold up

>Less planning and more living   
Burst the double bubble of comfort and convention   
and just do stuff   
even if you don’t know where it’ll lead   
but because   
This may sounds risky... and it is.

>The greater risk is fear failure more than mediocrity
