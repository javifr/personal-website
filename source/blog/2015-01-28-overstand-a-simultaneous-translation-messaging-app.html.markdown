# Overstand, a simultaneous translation messaging app

I'm excited to introduce one of my personal projects, it's called [Overstand](http://www.overstand.io). Let's say that is an app that allows you to go far beyond understanding: you chat with people from different countries in your own language, everyone is writing in their own language, everyone receives messages in their own language. **A simultaneous translation messaging app!**

It's in very Beta, but I made it as a holidays project as **I wanted to build a functional product from zero in no more than 4-5 days**. I took care of the naming, branding, concept, an hipothetical monetization path, the marketing website and of course the development of the app for Android, iOs and the web!

The design is focused on offering no barriers in order to start a conversation. In matter of seconds you can start messaging. No need to sign up or adding contacts, just share a link via e-mail and you can start a simultaneously translated conversation.

It's now available as a [web app](http://app.overstand.io), on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overstand.io) and on the [iTunes Store](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/overstand/id962440807?l=en&mt=8).

I'm quite happy with the results given the time spent on the creation, and has proven to be a very good exercise in order to identify the core things in order to build a product in little time.

**UPDATE**: Overstand has been featured on the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) showcase, take a look!
