# Overstand, a simultaneous translation messaging app

I'm excited to introduce a personal project. It's called Overstand, let's say that is an app that allows you to go far beyond understanding, it let's you chat with people from different countries in your own language, everyone is writing in their own language, everyone receives the messages in their own language. **A simultaneous translation app!**

It's in very Beta, but I made it as a holidays project. **I wanted to build a product from 0 in no more than 4-5 days**, I took care of the naming, branding, concept, an hipothetical monetization path, the marketing website and of course the development of the app for Android, iOs and the web!

It's now available as a web app, on the Play Store and on the way to the iTunes store.

I'm quite happy with the results given the time spent on the creation, and has proven to be a very good exercise in order to identify the core things in order to build a project in little time.

As I've learned interesting things building it, and came across very good resources, i'll share them with you.
